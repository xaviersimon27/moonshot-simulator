Moonshot Simulator

A simple Python simulator that evaluates "moonshot" strategies by running trials on random data and ranking the best performing outcomes.  
This project is my first step toward learning quantitative finance and data analysis.


Features
- Runs multiple simulations of potential outcomes
- Uses progress bars (`tqdm`) to track simulation progress
- Ranks the top 10 best performers based on returns
- Easy to expand with new strategies or datasets

Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xaviersimon27/moonshot-simulator.git
cd moonshot-simulator
